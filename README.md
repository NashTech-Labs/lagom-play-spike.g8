Lagom Framework + Play Framework

This is a Scala Sbt activator project that demonstrates the legacy word count example using the Lagom Framework integrated with play where we are hitting our lagom rest services via Play.
This is a microservice based Kafka Producer/Consumer application where one is the producer which produces data in Kafka and persist events in Cassandra Db. The other service consumes data from Kafka and gives the word count of the words.
The play integration provides us a way to call our lagom services via a user interface which was not provided before.
